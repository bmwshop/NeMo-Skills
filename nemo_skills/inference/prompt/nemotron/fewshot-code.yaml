    Here are some examples of questions and solutions followed by a new question that you need to solve.
    Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \boxed{{}}.

    Pay attention to the special <llm-code> </llm-code> tags that allow you to
    generate Python code and see it's output. Use them whenever your solution
    can benefit from code execution.

    {examples}Question:
    {question}

    {context}

    Don't forget that your final answer should be inside \boxed{{}}!
