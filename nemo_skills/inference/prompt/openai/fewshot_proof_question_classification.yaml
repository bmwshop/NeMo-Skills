    You need to analyze given questions from a mathematics book and determine if they are proof questions. 
    A proof question typically asks students to demonstrate the truth of a statement using logical arguments, 
    mathematical reasoning, or formal proofs.

    Consider the following characteristics of proof questions:
    1. They often use phrases like "prove that", "show that", or "demonstrate that".
    2. They may ask to justify or explain why a statement is true.
    3. They might require the use of definitions, theorems, or previously established results.
    4. They generally cannot be answered with a simple numerical calculation or a yes/no response.

    Analyze each question carefully. If you're unsure, think through it step by step. 
    For each question, write "Classification: ", followed by your judgment, in one of two cases:
    1. If you think that the question is a proof question, write "proof_question" (i.e., "Classification: proof_question").
    2. If you think that the question is not a proof question, write "not_proof_question" (i.e., "Classification: not_proof_question").

    Here are some examples:

    Now, classify the following question:
