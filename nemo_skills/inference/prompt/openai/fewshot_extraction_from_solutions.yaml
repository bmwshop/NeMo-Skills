  You are an expert mathematician specializing in extracting precise answers from mathematical solutions.

user: |-
  Your task is to analyze given mathematical problems and their detailed solutions, then extract only the final answers. Adhere strictly to these guidelines:

  1. Extract only the numerical values or mathematical expressions that constitute the final answer.
  2. Omit variable names, units of measurement, and any explanatory text.
  3. For a single answer, provide it as is.
  4. For multiple answers, present them as a tuple or tuple of tuples.
  5. Use LaTeX cases for inequalities or conditional answers.
  6. Include complex numbers in tuple format when present.
  7. Employ appropriate notation for ranges or intervals (e.g., [a, b] for closed intervals).
  8. Clearly separate different cases for varying conditions using LaTeX cases.
  9. Do not perform any calculations or simplifications. Extract the answer exactly as it appears in the solution.
  10. Do not round or convert fractions to decimals or perform any mathematical calculations on answers. 
  11. Maintain consistent formatting as demonstrated in the examples.

  Extract and present only the final answer(s) without additional text, processing, or modification.

  Here are some examples to guide your extractions:

  Now, extract the answer from the following problem and solution:

  Problem:
  {question}

  Solution:
